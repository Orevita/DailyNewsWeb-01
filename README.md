This is my first website which I built using html and css, till this point in time I still don't know how to use JavaScript make a website more interactive nor integrate it for visual apeal. Currently, I'm still trying to figure out how do I make this news website responsive (side note: I don't know what does the word "responsi" mean. So I just assumed that a responsive website means that it's compatible with every medium used to access the internet. TLDR: I would like to apologize if use the phrase "responsive" wrongly). Regardless, istill proud of myself for mama to built this website on my own (with small help from chatGPT on the animafor the footer).
